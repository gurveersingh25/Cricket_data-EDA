# Cricket Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of cricket match data aimed at uncovering meaningful insights into player performances, match outcomes, and game trends. The analysis leverages Python's powerful data science libraries to explore and visualize the dataset, providing a solid foundation for deeper predictive modeling or cricket analytics projects.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes detailed information about cricket matches, such as:

- Match dates and venues
- Teams involved
- Player statistics
- Scores and runs
- Match outcomes and results

*(Note: Please add the source or link to the dataset here if available. If the dataset is proprietary or large, mention how to access it.)*

## Key Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw cricket match data for analysis
- Perform statistical summaries and uncover patterns in player and team performance
- Visualize important metrics like runs distribution, win/loss ratios, and player contributions
- Identify trends and anomalies that can inform cricket strategies or predictions
